    <li>
    Preheat oven to 375Â°. On a lightly floured surface, 
    roll half the dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; 
    transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. 
    Chill while preparing filling. 
    In a small bowl, combine sugars, 
    flour and spices. In a large bowl, 
    toss apples with lemon juice. 
    Add sugar mixture; toss to coat. 
    Add filling to crust; dot with butter. 
    </li>
    <li>
    Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. 
    Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge. 
    Cut slits in top. 
    Beat egg white until foamy; 
    brush over crust. If desired, 
    prinkle with turbinado sugar and ground cinnamon. 
    </li>
    <li> 
    Bake on the lowest rack 60-70 minutes, until crust is 
    golden brown and filling is bubbly, covering with foil 
    halfway if crust begins to get too dark. Cool on a wire 
    rack. If desired, serve with ice cream and caramel sauce.
